# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## What this is

A React intranet layer on top of Supabase: auth, an AI chat assistant, shareable
"artifacts" (docs/code/HTML), file storage, and live realtime updates. The
Anthropic key is server-side only (a Supabase Edge Function); the browser holds
just the Supabase anon key and is protected by Postgres row-level security.

## Commands

```bash
npm install            # install deps
npm run dev            # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # tsc -b (typecheck) + vite build — run before pushing
npm run lint           # eslint
npm run typecheck      # tsc -b --noEmit
npm run gen:types      # regenerate src/lib/database.types.ts from the linked project
npm run start          # serve dist/ with SPA fallback (production / Railway)
```

Always run `npm run build` before committing UI/logic changes — it typechecks the whole app.

## Architecture & data flow

- **Auth:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` wraps Supabase Auth (session, sign in/up,
  magic link, sign out). `ProtectedRoute` gates the authenticated app; routing is in
  `src/App.tsx`.
- **Chat:** `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` writes user/assistant messages to Postgres and
  subscribes to `messages` via Supabase Realtime (websockets) for cross-device sync.
  Streaming comes from `src/lib/chat.ts` → `POST` to the `chat` edge function, which
  returns **SSE** lines `data: {"delta": "..."}` and ends with `data: [DONE]`.
  The function calls Anthropic; the client only sends the message history + the user's
  access token (+ the anon key as the `apikey` header).
- **Artifacts:** `ArtifactsPage` (list/create) and `ArtifactEditorPage` (edit, preview,
  set visibility, delete). Public/unlisted artifacts are read anonymously by slug in
  `PublicArtifactPage` at route `/share/a/:slug`.
- **Files:** `FilesPage` uploads to the private `files` storage bucket under
  `‹user-id›/…` and creates 7-day signed URLs for sharing.
- **Skills:** `SkillsPage` manages saved instruction sets (`skills` table). In
  `ChatPage`, typing `/` (or the ⚡ button) opens a skill menu; `runSkill()` sends
  the conversation context with the skill's `instructions` as the `system` override
  (via `streamChat(..., { system })`). Output mode `artifact` creates an artifact and
  drops a link in chat; `reply` posts the assistant message inline.

## Database & security model

Schema lives in `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`. Tables: `profiles`,
`conversations`, `messages`, `artifacts`, `files`. Enums: `visibility`
(`private`/`unlisted`/`public`), `message_role`, `artifact_type`.

**RLS is the security boundary — never weaken it:**
- Owner-only tables (`conversations`, `messages`, `files`, `profiles`) use
  `owner_id = auth.uid()` (profiles use `id = auth.uid()`).
- `artifacts` are readable by the owner **or** when `visibility <> 'private'` — that's
  how anonymous `/share/a/:slug` works.
- Storage `files` bucket is private; policies scope objects to `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text`.
- A trigger (`handle_new_user`) auto-creates a `profiles` row on signup. Trigger
  functions have `EXECUTE` revoked from API roles and pinned `search_path`.
- `messages` and `conversations` are in the `supabase_realtime` publication.

If you change the schema: update the migration, apply it, run `npm run gen:types`
(or hand-edit `database.types.ts` to match), and re-check Supabase security advisors.

## The chat edge function

`supabase/functions/chat/index.ts` (Deno). Uses the official Anthropic SDK
(`npm:@anthropic-ai/sdk`). Model defaults to **`claude-opus-4-8`** with
`thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }` and `output_config: { effort }`. Deployed with
`verify_jwt: true`. Reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (required), `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`,
`ANTHROPIC_EFFORT` from edge-function secrets.

**Anthropic conventions (do not change without reason):** default to `claude-opus-4-8`;
use **adaptive thinking** (`budget_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p` are removed on Opus
4.8 and will 400); stream responses. Don't downgrade the model to save cost — that's
the maintainer's call.

## Environment & secrets

| Scope | Var | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend (build-time) | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Inlined into the bundle |
| Frontend (build-time) | `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Public by design; RLS protects data |
| Edge secret | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `supabase secrets set ...` — never commit |
| Edge secret | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_EFFORT` | Optional overrides |

`VITE_*` are read at **build time** — they must exist before `npm run build`.

## Gotchas

- **Don't put secrets in the frontend.** Only the anon key belongs there; the Anthropic
  key is an edge-function secret.
- **Streaming format:** the function emits SSE `data: {"delta": "..."}`; `streamChat`
  parses on `\n\n` boundaries and stops at `[DONE]`. Keep both sides in sync.
- **Realtime de-dupe:** ChatPage tracks seen message IDs so an optimistic insert and the
  realtime echo don't double-render.
- **Auth redirects:** confirmation/magic-link emails use the Supabase project **Site URL**
  + Redirect URLs allowlist. Set these to the deployed origin or links go to localhost.
- **Mobile:** layout is responsive — sidebar is a slide-in drawer, the artifact editor
  stacks vertically. Don't reintroduce fixed side-by-side panels without `md:` guards.
- **Fresh project storage race:** on a brand-new Supabase project the `storage` schema
  may lag a few seconds; if applying the full migration fails on `storage.buckets`, apply
  the core tables first, then the storage section.

## Workflow

Trunk-based: commit and push directly to `main` (no PR flow). Run `npm run build` first.
Hosting auto-deploys from `main`.
